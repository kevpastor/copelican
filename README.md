To launch the app, you may need to install some tools such as the following \:

- node
- npm
- yeoman
- yo
- gulp
- bower
- gulp-angular

Then, use the command line : "gulp serve"
The website should be running on : http://localhost:3000

To do this, I followed a tutorial which is available here : https://www.meetterry.com/blog/-K27qrq64mstKL7QPxDs/automatisez-vos-projets-angularjs-avec-gulp-bower-et-yeoman
